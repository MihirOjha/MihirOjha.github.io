        <h3 id="about">About</h3>
        <p class="project-text">I am a self-motivated, enthusiastic team worker with a keen interest in Machine Learning and Data Science. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to work well in a team environment. I understand the importance of collaborating with others and strive to contribute my skills and knowledge to achieve our shared goals. I am passionate about solving complex business problems through data storytelling and helping make jobs better and more efficient by understanding and supporting the organizational direction. I enjoy being strategic with data and I excel at realizing what needs to be acquired to increase the value of the existing data.<br> <br>

          In addition to my passion for data science, I also have a strong interest in sports analysis and fintech. I enjoy using data and analytics to understand and predict trends in these areas and am always seeking out opportunities to learn and grow in these fields.<br> <br>

          I enjoy working directly with clients and establishing meaningful and transparent relationships to foster mutual growth. I love learning about what makes an individual business succeed and its business model to see where I can help. <br><br>

          </div>
          <p class="project-text"> During my time at SFU, I was part of a team that created a podcast about mental health specifically targeting university students. We each shared our struggles with mental health while attending university and shared our coping strategies to overcome our difficulties. We took an evidence-based approach to give guidelines and advice on how to enjoy time at university. I also interviewed a psychology professor that advocates art therapy for depression and the benefits of having creative outlets in our lives.

      <h3 id="fun">Fun</h3>
          <p class="project-text">I was born in India and came to Canada in 2016 to pursue my higher education. Canada is a beautiful country with a diverse range of natural landscapes, and there are plenty of ways to explore and enjoy them. During the winter months, I’ve hit the slopes in Whistler, Vernon, and most recently Banff. I’ve also ice-skated on the frozen lake Louis. In the summer, I try to do a bit of hiking (Grouse grind is a workout and a half!) and enjoy water sports. No matter what time of year it is, Canada's natural beauty is always worth exploring. <br><br>
            I'm a big fan of staying active and trying new things, so I enjoy weightlifting and other forms of exercise. I also love spending time with friends and family, whether it's playing board games or just hanging out. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and I always have a book or two on the go (currently diving into the deep world of Brandon Sanderson). I'm also an adventurous person and love to travel and explore new places. Whether it's a short road trip or a longer international trip, I'm always up for an adventure. My travel goal is to visit the modern seven wonders of the world (current progress: 2/7). <br><br>
            I am also into playing all kinds of sports. I have played national tournaments in tennis and basketball back in India, so feel free to invite me to any game session. I love a challenge and having healthy competition!!
